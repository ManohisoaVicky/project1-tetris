### How do you play Tetris?

You bring down blocks from the top of the game board. You can move the blocks right and left, and you can rotate them. The goal is to complete as many rows filled with blocks as much as possible. The game ends when a tower of block touches the top of the game board.

### My goal and plans.

My goal is to recreate a working Tetris game. 

To start, I pondered on whether it would have been best to use html divs as grids or html canvas for the game board. After much research, I decided to use html canvas. One of the reasons why I chose html canvas has to do with the rotations of the tetrominos. I figured using html canvas would more practical.
